# Auto Project

## Important: Keep Skill Definition in Sync

When making changes to this project (commands, features, usage, etc.), you MUST also update the corresponding skill definition at:

`~/.claude/skills/auto`

This ensures Claude Code's skill system stays in sync with the actual implementation.
